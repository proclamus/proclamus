## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick. Since I was a little boy I have great interest in technologies and that's why I graduated in Information Systems from "Universidade Federal Fluminense", in Brazil.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as FullStack using Java, C#, python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.
- ðŸŒ± I wanna learn Flutter in the future and master my knowledge with C#.
- ðŸ¤” My GitHUB is a little empty, I wanna fill it with more projects that use backend technologies.
- âš¡ Fact:  I love good music and online games in my free time.
